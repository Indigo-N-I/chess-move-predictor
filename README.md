# chess-move-predictor

The purpose of this project is to see if I can make a machine learning algorithm that can predict my moves using the games that I have played in lichess. It is intended to help me see where I tend to make mistakes in my chess games so that I can improve. If the results are really good, it may prove useful to become implemented into custom built chess algorithms against specific opponents.
